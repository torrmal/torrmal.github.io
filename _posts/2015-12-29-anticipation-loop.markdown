<p>Over the past 18 months -Since my son's birth until now- I keep asking to myself; How does learning work inside that tiny yet everyday more clever person? Beyond all the chemical mechanics and immense complexity, can one, out of mere observation deduce "simple" algorithms that describe a good amount of what it takes to learn as humnas do? If there are such, can a computer learn in a similar way?.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">An experiment</h2>

What if I take a video and make the computer predict each subsequent frame from the latter, and it rewards or punishes its learning lagorithm based on how accurately predicts the future frame. What if we stack these predictors to predict furhter and further into unseen frames. What will the computer learn? 

<blockquote>What if most of our thoughts are the result of a chain of predictions? The deeper in the chain the most complicated the thoughts can be.</blockquote>
